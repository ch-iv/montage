# Montage
Montage is a small program that can present C code with syntax highlighting.

### Usage
To display a file:
```
./montage <file.c>
```

Use Make to build:
```
make
```

### What is the purpose of this program?
This program is a part of a code-oriented presentation suite I am working on. Presenting code is a difficult task -- Montage makes it easier.
